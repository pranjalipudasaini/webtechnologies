    <h1>Fall Guys</h1>
    <img src="fall guys.jpeg" alt="fall guys">
    <p>Fall Guys is a free-to-play platform battle royale game developed by Mediatonic. The game involves up to 60 players who control jellybean-like creatures and compete against each other in a series of randomly selected mini-games, such as obstacle courses or tag. Players are eliminated as the rounds progress until, eventually, the last remaining player is crowned the winner. The game draws inspiration from game shows like Takeshi's Castle. It's a Knockout, Wipeout, and playground games like tag and British Bulldog.</p>
